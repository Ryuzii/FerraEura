## üîß Developer Experience Improvements

### Enhanced TypeScript Support
- **Comprehensive type definitions** for new features
- **Performance metrics interfaces** with detailed typing
- **Node health status types** for monitoring
- **Memory usage interfaces** for analysis
- **Enhanced event signatures** with error handling types

### API Enhancements
- **Memory management controls** (start/stop automatic cleanup)
- **Performance metric access** with detailed analytics
- **Node health status API** for monitoring
- **Smart search methods** with advanced options
- **Batch search capabilities** for efficiency

### Error Handling Improvements
- **Retry logic in player operations** with configurable attempts
- **Smart error detection** for retryable vs non-retryable errors
- **Enhanced error context** with operation details
- **Graceful degradation** for failed operations

## üéØ Quality of Life Improvements

### Automatic Management
- **Memory management starts automatically** on initialization
- **Cache pruning happens automatically** with size limits
- **Performance tracking runs automatically** with minimal overhead
- **Error recovery attempts automatically** with smart logic

### Configuration Enhancements
- **Flexible memory thresholds** (default: 85% heap usage)
- **Configurable cleanup intervals** (default: 15 minutes)
- **Adjustable retry attempts** (default: 3)
- **Customizable cache sizes and TTL** for optimization

### Backward Compatibility
- **All existing APIs maintained** for seamless upgrades
- **New features are opt-in** or have sensible defaults
- **Enhanced existing methods** without breaking changes
- **Improved error messages** with more context

## üìã Migration Guide

### For Existing Users
1. **No breaking changes** - all existing code continues to work
2. **New features are automatic** - memory management starts by default
3. **Enhanced performance** - caching and retry logic improve reliability
4. **Better error handling** - more resilient to network issues

### New Methods Available
```javascript
// Performance monitoring
const metrics = tera.getPerformanceMetrics();
tera.resetPerformanceMetrics();

// Memory management
tera.startMemoryManagement();
tera.stopMemoryManagement();
tera.performMemoryCleanup();

// Smart search
const results = await tera.smartSearch(query, requester, options);
const batchResults = await tera.batchSearch(queries, requester);

// Node health
const health = node.getHealthStatus();
const isHealthy = node.isHealthy();

// Enhanced queue features
const stats = queue.getStats();
const searchResults = queue.searchAdvanced(query, options);
const removedDuplicates = queue.removeDuplicates('uri');
```
