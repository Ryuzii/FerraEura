  - Increased cache size from 1000 to 2500 entries
  - Extended TTL from 15 minutes to 30 minutes
  - Improved cache hit rate monitoring
  - Better cache eviction strategies

- **üîß Node Health Monitoring**
  - `getHealthStatus()` method for detailed node health information
  - `isHealthy()` boolean check for node status
  - Connection stability tracking and consecutive failure monitoring
  - Average ping calculation and health scoring

- **üìö Comprehensive Documentation**
  - Complete HTML documentation with interactive navigation
  - API reference with detailed method signatures

### Enhanced
- **Performance Optimizations**
  - 2.5x larger cache size for better hit rates
  - Improved memory usage with automatic cleanup
  - Enhanced error handling reduces failed requests
  - Better connection stability and retry mechanisms

- **Developer Experience**
  - Enhanced TypeScript definitions for all new features
  - Comprehensive documentation with examples
  - Better error messages and debugging information
  - Improved method naming and consistency

- **Reliability Improvements**
  - Automatic memory management prevents memory leaks
  - Intelligent error handling reduces service interruptions
  - Better node health monitoring for failover decisions
  - Enhanced queue management with duplicate prevention

### Changed
- Cache configuration: increased size and TTL for better performance
- Memory management: now automatic by default with configurable thresholds
- Error handling: enhanced with retry logic and better classification
- Documentation: completely rewritten with comprehensive examples

### Fixed
- Memory leaks in long-running applications
- Network error handling edge cases
- Queue management performance issues
- TypeScript definition completeness

## [0.1.1-rc.2] - 2025-08-08
### Added
- Automatic player migration (failover): When a Lavalink node goes offline and dynamicSwitching is enabled, all affected players are automatically moved to a healthy node and playback resumes from the last position.
### Changed
- Refactored Teralink options to a clean, nested structure (source, rest, resume, node, lazyLoad, etc.) for easier setup and customization
- Added intelligent caching for super-fast track and playlist resolution
- Optimized memory and CPU usage: added cache pruning, event listener and timer cleanup for long-running, high-traffic bots
- Reviewed and optimized loops and data structures for performance
- Enhanced event system for full control and customization
- Updated all code samples and documentation to use the new config style and highlight these improvements
